The cans are standard 12 oz size with easy-to-open tops, and the packaging clearly lists the ingredients and nutritional information, showing zero calories and no added sugars.\n\nThe lemon-lime flavor is noticeable but not overpowering. It has a crisp, fizzy mouthfeel typical of carbonated water, with subtle citrus notes throughout. I noticed the carbonation level stayed consistent from the first sip to the last, and it didn’t go flat quickly when left open for a short period.\n\nThe absence of sweeteners or artificial flavors is clear in the taste — it doesn’t have a sweet aftertaste or heaviness that some flavored waters can have. The cans are convenient for grab-and-go use, fitting easily into a cooler or fridge shelf. After trying multiple cans over a few days, the flavor and fizziness remained consistent across the pack.\n\nOverall, this sparkling water provides a citrus-flavored, fizzy drink option without calories, and it can be a refreshing choice with meals or as a standalone beverage."

      "flavor": "Blackberry Lemonade",
      "body": "I recently purchssed this blackberry lemonade sparkling water from Waterloo and I must say, it's a game changer for those of us looking to quench our thirst with something a bit more exciting than plain old water. The first thing I noticed was the burst of flavor. The blackberry and lemonade combination is not only refreshing but also perfectly balanced. It's like a summer afternoon in a can, minus the pesky bees.\n\nWhat I really appreciate about this sparkling water is its commitment to health. Zero calories, zero sugar, and zero artificial sweeteners? It's like finding a unicorn in the world of flavored beverages. It's reassuring to enjoy a drink that doesn't make me feel like I'm compromising on my health goals. Plus, with no sodium, it's a great option for those who are watching their salt intake.\n\nNow, let's talk about the fizz. It's just right – not too overpowering but enough to give that satisfying sparkling sensation. However, I did find that the fizziness doesn't last very long once the can is opened. So, it's best enjoyed soon after cracking it open, unless you prefer your sparkling water on the flatter side, which I guess could be a thing for some people.\n\nOne minor quibble is the aftertaste. While not overly pronounced, there's a slight aftertaste that might not appeal to everyone. It's not a dealbreaker for me, but worth mentioning for those with sensitive taste buds.\n\nIn summary, Waterloo's blackberry lemonade sparkling water is a delightful treat for anyone looking for a zero-guilt, flavorful drink. It's a fantastic alternative to sugary sodas and a great way to stay hydrated. The balance of flavors and the right amount of carbonation make it a standout choice. Just remember to enjoy it quickly after opening for the best experience!"

      "flavor": "Peach",
      "body": "I have this ordered every month but on occasion I'll find another new drink by waterloo , bubbly or simple truth that has awesome drinks and amazon has them all. Now I order peach because it's one of my favorites by waterloo, I get mango by bubbly because it's easy on my stomach and recently my favorite is lemon lime by some simple truth. Its a great drink that free of salt and sugar. It has no after taste of any sugars and sugars that are substitutes all three are great sparkling water. waterloo has strawberry, grape, lemon lime, peach, cherry limeade(thats my husbands fav) and black raspberry, cherry and a lot others in the waterloo selection some are even mixed with another one yet Im not into anything to busy. Bubbly I found mango so far to be great and some days I crave only that but right now im on a kick for simple truth lemon lime. You get the same amount of drinks 8 cans. same amount 12 ounces and you only pay 2:99$ for this but it could be a special because it's a new drink. strange thing is if I buy this item on amazon or any other site its more expensive but not that IM saying amazon isn't fair but right now the ralphs in mission valley is only charging 2:99 for that and it has so many other kinds but amazon sells them just in bulk so its a bit more expensive yet worth it. If given the chance try cucumber melon it's also really good. I dont like anything sweet so im always buying candy and dried fruit on amazon thats sour and tart and dried fruit not freeze dried candy I get that too but usually its sour beers, hot red tamale brand and tart and sour/ plus mixed berries and tarjin tamarindo get group. I dont always write reviews yet amazon is there and picks up the slack or honors something you ordered that was over night and if its late or you keep getting messages telling you if you dont receive your item by a certain time they'll send it to you immediately, if thats true I wouldn't know but I trust them and they also reimburse you although your getting the item but I suggest you sy no unless you want your items sent to you slower..LOL no Im joking they dont do that but if they send you your item no need to be reimbursed right? Okay don\\e with my review hope I could help btw your drinks come overnight. Good luck"

      "body": "The sparkling water itself? Excellent. Waterloo is easily my favorite sparkling water brand and their range of flavors is wonderful. I've purchased from in stores previously, but have had a hard time finding it again/different flavors, so I decided to order through Amazon. The reason it's getting 3 stars is because 2 of the 3 cases I ordered (all 3 were different flavors) came super damaged. The boxes were ripped open and I assumed they had spilled out because some of the cans were upright while others were upside down. Several cans from both of the damaged cases were totally messed up. Handling of the actual product and the packing of the product needs to be better."

      "body": "Amazing product, but AMAZON always delivers these to us dented, bloated and sometimes the boxes are broken. That being said, we still buy them bc they're delicious. I honestly believe they buy the open box specials from Waterloo. There is no way this is the only Amazon product that consistently come broken."

      "flavor": "Tropical Fruit",
      "body": "Waterloo Tropical Fruit Sparkling Water is a solid four-star refreshment that brings a burst of the tropics straight to your taste buds. The flavor is bright, fun, and just fruity enough to make you forget you’re not actually sitting on a beach somewhere (sadly, no palm trees included). With zero calories, zero sugar, and no weird aftertaste, it’s a great guilt-free choice for when plain water just won’t cut it.\n\nThe carbonation is on point, too—crisp and bubbly without being too aggressive. It’s perfect for sipping straight from the can or pouring over ice with a squeeze of lime for an extra zing. The only thing keeping it from five stars? It’s delicious but not quite life-changing. Still, it’s way better than a lot of flavored waters I’ve tried, and I’ll happily keep a few in the fridge for when I need a little tropical pick-me-up.\n\nPro tip from a guy who knows his sparkling water: Pair it with some fresh fruit slices or use it as a mixer for cocktails or mocktails. It’ll take your drink game up a notch. Four stars for a solid, feel-good fizz. Alright, alright, sparkle-right!"
